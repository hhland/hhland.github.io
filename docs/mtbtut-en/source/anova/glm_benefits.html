<div class="use">
<h2 class="sectiontitle">Use 1: To perform an ANOVA analysis using
a variety of data</h2>

<p>A beverage manufacturer is developing a new product and wants to
know if sweetener type, color, and precise carbonation level are
significantly related to consumer satisfaction. Because the company
is comparing groups (in this case, different beverage
formulations), a one-way ANOVA seems appropriate, but one-way ANOVA
cannot analyze these predictors.</p>

<p class="p">The General Linear Model (GLM) is the most flexible
form of ANOVA. It can model multiple predictor variables, both
categorical and continuous. Additionally, GLM can include different
types of factors, terms, and designs.</p>
</div>

<div class="use">
<h2 class="sectiontitle">Use 2: To test the equality of means and
interactions between different groups</h2>

<p>A vacuum cleaner manufacturer is considering switching to a
cheaper type of motor, but it wants assurance that the cheaper
motor doesn't negatively affect performance. The company tests
vacuum cleaners with both motor types on a variety of carpet styles
to see how much dirt remains in the carpet. Do the two motor types
have similar performance across carpet types?</p>

<p class="p">Sometimes, knowing that a real difference exists is
all that matters. Use GLM to find a significant difference between
multiple groups and to see whether the effect of one factor
interacts with the level of another factor.</p>
</div>

<div class="use">
<h2 class="sectiontitle">Use 3: To assess the specific differences
between groups</h2>

<p>A construction company needs to find the best method for sealing
cracks between sections of concrete. They test three sealants using
two application methods with each sealant. The company wants a
durable seal, but it doesn't want to pay more for a marginal
increase in durability. Perhaps the second or even third best
combination of sealant and application method is the right
choice.</p>

<p class="p">Often, knowing that groups have different averages is
insufficient, and you need to delve deeper into group-by-group
comparisons. GLM can estimate the differences between specific
groups, which allows you to make such comparisons.</p>
</div>

<div class="use">
<h2 class="sectiontitle">Use 4: To predict the response for a new
set of observations</h2>

<p>A customer support manager examines his departmentÂ’s extensive
records and finds that the number of calls received on any given
day seems to be dependent on a number of factors such as day of the
week, month, and number of sales from the previous month. The
manager wants to use this information to predict how many calls to
expect, so that he can schedule the appropriate number of operators
for each shift.</p>

<p class="p">With GLM, you can use observed data to describe the
relationship between a number of predictors and a single response.
After this relationship is well defined, you can predict a new
response value whenever you have a new set of predictor values.</p>
